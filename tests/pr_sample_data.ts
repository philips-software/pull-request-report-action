It also restructures the app in a way I think is easier to navigate and think about.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Cleanup\\r\\n* Webpack config based on [this](https://github.com/taniarascia/webpack-boilerplate).\\r\\n* Remove unnecessary/unused build machinery and unused files.\\r\\n* Remove Google Analytics integration\\r\\n* Dynamically generate artifact and use default WebPack output directory\\r\\n* Update most dependencies, removed unused or unnecessary dependincies\\r\\n* Add a script to visualise the size of the compiled build artifact (bundle-size-analyse)\\r\\n* Use ts-loader rather than babel to compile ts/tsx (type-checking)\\r\\n* Upgrade to webpack 5\\r\\n* Remove reliance on polyfilled Node APIs (path and zip)\\r\\n* Add linting for use of abstract equality and block delimiters with braces\\r\\n* Add tests for the front-end using Jest and react-testing-library. Including tests for `fetch()` And GProfiler previously introduced.\\r\\n* Use `jest-css-modules-transform` to handle imports for CSS. Version is intentionally pinned as \\"4.0.2\\" breaks tests.\\r\\n* Wrap the old API in a scary `LegacyAPI` name\\r\\n* Extract some of the complexity in the `App` component in new `Main` and `FullPageNotify` components.\\r\\n* Turn on strict TypeScript type checking and fix all type errors.\\r\\n* Remove as much CSS as possible and simplify DOM structure\\r\\n* Introduce a TEST_ONLY flag to avoid hard-to-test side-effects from the legacy API while testing.\\r\\n* Add local CSS imported only by the component that uses it.\\r\\n* Remove as many uses of Lodash as possible\\r\\n* Add a utility function `zipLists` to `zip()` a list of lists.\\r\\n* Refactor the UploadModal to be responsive.\\r\\n* Reduce use of `default exports`\\r\\n\\r\\n### Code structure and redesign\\r\\n* Document code style and design decisions in CONTRIBUTING.md\\r\\n* Change the structure of `getFeature()` requests and responses\\r\\n* Add a \\"filter by type/category\\" argument to `getFeature()` requests\\r\\n* Redisign of FeatureSearchBox components following the guidelines outlines in CONTRIBUTING.md\\r\\n* LegacyAPI no longer tracks UUID, sessionMode, sidebar visibility, and cookie consent. These have been moved to Redux.\\r\\n* Wire in Redux to existing components where useful.\\r\\n* Use `immer` to update Redux state.\\r\\n* Add a `Result` type similar to the backend `Result` type.\\r\\n\\r\\n### UI\\r\\n* Viewer component is now responsive and does less work to render data\\r\\n* Redisign of UI, the whole UI is a little more responsive and more traditionally \\"single-page\\".\\r\\n* Centre the Welcome page and make it scrollable.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Breaking changes and known issues\\r\\n* Does not keep (removes) the functionality for \\"locking\\" related search entries on searches like \\"batch\\" and \\"All clusters\\" (#447)\\r\\n* ~~This PR breaks ViewerSidebar \\"Clustering Controls\\". Fixing this is out of scope for the PR, this should instead be fixed after @dweemx cleanup of the ViewerSidebar is merged.~~\\r\\n* Lasso selections are not \\"remembered\\" when switching between tabs.\\r\\n* The Babel config file is necessary for Jest. It duplicates the webpack config. If you have a solution to remove the duplication please let me know.\\r\\n* [VISUAL/STYLING] Annotation voting popup does not persist on mouseover (#427)\\r\\n* ~~Compare tab break when performing a DnD of one of the annotation onto a viewer.~~\\r\\n* [VISUAL/STYLING] Styling changes cause text to overlap in many locations (i.e. Loom selection in sidebar) (#428)\\r\\n* [BREAKING] Getting metadata from a cell section fails (#429)\\r\\n* [MINOR] Settings in sidebar do not display when selecting a loom, only after selecting a gene or changing loom (#430) \\r\\n* [BREAKING] Selecting a cluster in the results, always selects the first result by name (#431)\\r\\n* [BREAKING] Adding annotations fails with python error (#432)\\r\\n* [MINOR] Annotation labels remain after clearing feature (#433)\\r\\n* [VISUAL/STYLING] Regulon tab plots done fill screen (#434)\\r\\n* [MAJOR] Selecting a regulon causes an infinite loop in the backend (#435)\\r\\n* [BREAKING] Regulon histogram never displays data (#436)\\r\\n* [MAJOR] Unable to search for clusters by annotation name (#437)\\r\\n* [MINOR] Permalink button does nothing (#438)\\r\\n* [MAJOR] Compare tab does not work with more that one annotation per viewer (#439)",\n  "changedFiles": 109,\n  "closed": true,\n  "closedAt": "2021-05-28T08:23:55Z",\n  "comments": [\n    {\n      "id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNTA5MDAyNg==",\n      "author": {\n        "login": "MaybeJustJames"\n      },\n      "authorAssociation": "COLLABORATOR",\n      "body": "Add PR summary points to documentation (conribution manual??)",\n      "createdAt": "2020-10-23T07:42:19Z",\n      "includesCreatedEdit": false,\n      "isMinimized": false,\n      "minimizedReason": "",\n      "reactionGroups": [],\n      "url": "https://github.com/aertslab/SCope/pull/381#issuecomment-715090026",\n      "viewerDidAuthor": false\n    },\n    {\n      "id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNjU2ODQxMw==",\n      "author": {\n        "login": "dweemx"\n      },\n      "authorAssociation": "CONTRIBUTOR",\n      "body": "/!\\\\ I noticed that `<- Pevious` and  `Next ->` buttons of the cluster controls (right side bar) don\'t work anymore.

So I suggest we use `.nvmrc` file to properly state which Node version this app requires.\\r\\n- [x] The markers table should not be displayed (actually not exist) when querying for `All Clusters` in the `Gene` page.\\r\\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16015936/103792400-e205e480-5043-11eb-9586-714691ff627f.png)\\r\\n- [x] When switching from loom, the viewer is not reloaded with the embedding\\r\\n- [x] After having switched from loom, colors are not properly assigned to dots anymore:\\r\\n  - To reproduce:\\r\\n    1. Load one loom, search for `All Clusters`\\r\\n    2. Load other loom, clear search box and search for `All Clusters`\\r\\n- [x] When switching from embeddings/coordinates, the scatterplot is not updated.\\r\\n- [x] All annotations page is empty/blank while loom contains community annotations\\r\\n- [x] Some viewers are missing in the compare tab.
